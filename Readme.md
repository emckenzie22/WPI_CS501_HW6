DS501 HW6 - Case Study 3

This Shiny application was made from the Life Expectancy data set found on Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who

Compared to others, this data set had a large amount of data points and multiple columns that might offer good correlation to the output column, the typical life expectancy of that group.

This application uses linear regression to compare parameters in the dataset with life expectancy.  The user selected parameter is compared with life expectancy using the r squared term in the lm() function and also shown on the graph.

This topic is interesting because it contains many data points and shows how countries vary with health parameters.  I had originally thought that health parameters would have universal impacts on longevity but being able to play with the application shows that there are definite differences in how things like alcohol affect longevity.
